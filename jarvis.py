"""
JARVIS v3.0 — voice assistant: bilingual, web search, tools, red-orange orb
============================================================================
(Version is updated by hand on each change. Current: v4.67 — 30 Jun 2026.)

What works now:
  * Wake word "Hey JARVIS" (continuous background listening); empty screen until
    woken. Pre-roll buffer so the first command word isn't cut off.
  * Voice in (Whisper) + voice out (edge-tts). English voice = British "Alfred"
    style (en-GB-Ryan), slowed/lowered for a calmer butler delivery.
  * Language lock: Hebrew->Hebrew, anything else->English. Never a 3rd language.
  * Continuous conversation: answers a follow-up without needing the wake word.
  * Web search in real time (decides on its own when current info is needed).
  * Tool Use: open_app (closed allow-list) and save_note (to Obsidian).
  * Function keys: F1 typing box, F2 save last exchange, F3 repeat last reply.
  * Noise filtering (high threshold + short-transcript discard).
  * Weather defaults to Alfei Menashe, Celsius only. Personal/family context.
  * GLOWING ORB in red-orange ("molten core") across all states, Pillow-rendered
    with a near-black transparency key (no pink halo); canvas fallback if no PIL.
  * Forces its own working directory + windowless relaunch via pythonw, so it
    runs cleanly when launched from start_jarvis.bat (double-click).

Changelog:
  v4.67 - Reliability + safety pass. WAKE: transcribe_wake no longer
          stacks VAD + double no-speech filtering, which on the tiny
          model trimmed a short isolated "Achilles"/"Jarvis" to an empty
          string so the wake never fired and nothing came up on screen;
          it now decodes permissively and relies on WAKE_GATE +
          detect_wake. The wake hit-guard loosened from <=4 to <=8 words
          so a phrase expansion no longer discards a valid wake; mic-open
          failures are surfaced on-screen instead of only printed.
          DISPLAY: animate() is now crash-proof (whole frame guarded,
          reschedule in finally) so one bad render frame can't kill the
          loop and leave the orb permanently hidden; _face_req applies
          the expand immediately so the orb pops the instant the wake
          fires. BRAIN: conversation_history is guarded by a single
          _think_lock (shared by voice / Telegram / the /ask HTTP thread),
          bounded to 24 messages, with orphaned-tool_use self-healing -
          fixing cross-thread corruption (400 "roles must alternate"),
          unbounded token growth, and the permanent-400 poisoning after a
          mid-tool truncation; max_tokens 500 -> 1024; open_achilles added
          to the tool-dispatch whitelist (was missing -> 400). SECURITY:
          /ask and the mutating /todo endpoints are now loopback-only (the
          proxy binds 0.0.0.0 for the phone; those ran the brain / spent
          API budget / mutated state with no auth). RESOURCES: fired
          timers prune themselves; the v4.40 IPv4 patch honours an
          explicit address family and falls back gracefully. LOGIC: a
          quiz can always be cancelled; "I ran the tests"/"רצתי לחנות"
          are no longer logged as workouts; "everything is better" no
          longer clears an injury. VESSELS: AIS heading/COG sentinels
          (511/360/null) are validated so a ship is never drawn at a fake
          bearing, and ts refreshes on every message. Also a new
          worldview.html frontend that renders the live ships (plus
          aircraft and USGS quakes) from the /vessels and /flights feeds.
  v4.42 - Prompt caching to cut API cost. JARVIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT
          (~4k tokens of memory, city list, family context, and
          tool rules) was being re-sent on every API call and on
          every tool-use loop iteration - the bulk of the input
          bill. think() now splits the system prompt into the
          constant JARVIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT (marked cache_control=
          ephemeral) plus a tiny uncached block for the language
          note and current timestamp, so the cached prefix stays
          byte-identical between calls. Anthropic caches the
          constant for ~5 min and bills cache hits at ~10%% of the
          input rate, roughly halving the bill with no quality
          change. A plain-string fallback (sys_prompt_plain) is
          kept for the no-tools retry path. Spend is visible via
          the v4.30 'budget' / 'התקציב' command.
  v4.41 - system_health: real live probe for Calendar / Gmail
          instead of file-existence check. v4.24 only verified
          credentials.json and token.json were on disk, so a
          revoked refresh token still reported 'OK'. Now
          actually calls _calendar_service() and runs
          calendarList().list(maxResults=1) - reports OK only
          if the live call succeeds, FAIL with exception class
          name if anything raises. Gmail shares the token so a
          calendar pass implies Gmail too.
  v4.40 - Force IPv4 for outbound network. Tiny monkey-patch
          at module-import replaces socket.getaddrinfo with an
          AF_INET-only wrapper so every TCP connect from this
          process goes over IPv4. Fixes WinError 10060 timeouts
          on calendar / Gmail caused by httplib2 picking IPv6
          first when local IPv6 routing is broken (common on
          Israeli ISPs). Idempotent (flag on socket module).
          Process-local: does NOT change Windows network or
          DNS settings.
  v4.39 - Weight logging + 68kg red-line (coach brick 4).
          log_weight() sets last_weight_kg / last_weight_date
          and appends to a weights history list; this is what
          finally lights up v4.28's briefing red-line warning
          and v4.38's summary. weight_check() reports latest
          weight vs weight_target_min_kg (default 68): below /
          near / ok, days since, and trend vs previous weigh-
          in. Voice: 'log weight 70.5' / 'שקלתי 71' to log;
          'weight check' / 'מה המשקל' to check. Fully additive
          - no _boot/TTS changes. Reuses v4.33 _load/_save.
  v4.38 - Weekly training summary (coach brick 3, read-only).
          weekly_summary() digests this ISO week's workouts
          (count + type breakdown), latest weight vs red-line,
          today's nutrition vs target, active injuries, and a
          pointer to the progress report. Voice: 'weekly
          summary' / 'סיכום שבועי'. Writes nothing; reuses
          v4.33 _load_training_log.
  v4.37 - Fitness benchmarks & progress (coach brick 2).
          Structured test logging into fitness_tests +
          progress vs EDITABLE targets in standards{} (both in
          training_log.json). Metrics: run_2km, run_3km,
          pullups, pushups, situps, swim_400m. Voice: 'log run
          2k 8:45' / 'log pullups 18' / 'תרשום מתח 18' to log;
          'progress' / 'מצב כושר' for a report (latest vs
          target + delta from previous test); 'set target
          pullups 20' / 'יעד מתח 20' to change a target.
          Targets are placeholders, NOT official numbers -
          edit standards.<metric>. Reuses v4.33 _load/_save.
  v4.36 - Workout logging (combat fitness coach, brick 1).
          log_workout() appends to the workouts list in
          training_log.json and refreshes the v4.28 briefing
          fields (last_workout_type, last_workout_date,
          weekly_workouts) with an automatic ISO-week reset;
          recent_workouts() reports this week's count plus the
          last 5 with relative dates and auto-classified type
          (cardio/swim/strength/general). Voice: 'log workout:
          X' / 'I ran 5k' / 'I trained X' / 'תרשום אימון X' /
          'רצתי X' to log; 'workout status' / 'מה אימנתי השבוע'
          to recall. Raw text stored verbatim. Reuses v4.33's
          _load/_save_training_log.
  v4.35 - Injury / recovery tracker. log_injury() appends an
          entry (desc, logged date, status) to the injuries
          list in training_log.json; injury_status() reports
          active injuries with relative dates;
          mark_recovered() flags a matching active injury as
          recovered (no keyword needed when only one is
          active). Voice: 'log injury: X' / 'I hurt my X' /
          'תרשום פציעה X' to log; 'injury recovered: X' / 'my
          X healed' / 'החלמתי מX' to clear; 'injury status' /
          'מצב פציעות' to check. Recovered entries stay in the
          JSON for history but are filtered from the active
          report. Reuses v4.33's _load/_save_training_log.
  v4.34 - Self-test / quiz mode. 'quiz me on X' / 'test me'
          / 'תבחן אותי על X' picks a knowledge note in that
          domain (or any note), has Sonnet write one
          exam-style question + model answer, stores it as
          pending in a lock-guarded _quiz_state, and speaks
          only the question. A pending-quiz check at the top
          of think() routes the user's next utterance to
          evaluate_quiz_answer, which has Sonnet grade it
          (correct / partial / wrong + the missed point) and
          clears the state. 'stop' / 'cancel' / 'עזוב' while
          pending drops the quiz. One quiz pending at a time;
          both calls are tracked by the v4.30 budget.
  v4.33 - Nutrition / macro tracker. log_calories() and
          log_protein() accumulate daily intake in
          training_log.json (shared with v4.28), resetting
          each calendar day via a nutrition_date field.
          nutrition_status() reports today's calories and
          protein vs targets (defaults 3000 kcal / 130 g,
          editable as target_calories / target_protein_g).
          Voice: 'log 2500 calories' / 'add 40 grams
          protein' / 'אכלתי 2500 קלוריות' to log; 'nutrition'
          / 'macros' / 'תזונה' to check. The log parser
          requires a number, a unit word, and a logging verb
          so questions like 'how many calories in a banana'
          do not false-trigger a log.
  v4.32 - Decisions log. log_decision() appends a timestamped
          entry to Obsidian_Vault/Decisions.md (its own
          Markdown note); recent_decisions() reads back the
          last 5 with relative dates. Voice: 'log decision:
          X' / 'record decision X' / 'תרשום החלטה X' to log;
          'my decisions' / 'recent decisions' / 'מה החלטתי'
          to review. A parsing intercept extracts the
          decision text after the trigger; a review intercept
          matches the read-back phrases. Both run in think()
          before the model so logging is deterministic.
  v4.31 - Daily vault backup. A new backup_vault() helper
          creates a timestamped DEFLATED zip of the entire
          Obsidian_Vault folder under ./backups/ next to
          jarvis.py, then prunes to BACKUP_KEEP=14 newest.
          Auto-trigger: first launch of each calendar day
          via .jarvis_last_backup marker (same pattern as
          .jarvis_last_briefing), running in a daemon
          thread so wake-loop startup is never blocked by
          zip compression. Voice trigger: a deterministic
          intercept catches 'backup' / 'backup now' /
          'גיבוי' / 'גבה' / 'תגבה את הפתקים' and runs the
          backup synchronously, returning file count and
          zip size. Local-only by design - no Google Drive
          OAuth scope change; Drive upload can be added
          later without touching this layer.
  v4.30 - Monthly Anthropic API cost budget. A monkey-patch
          on anthropic.resources.messages.Messages.create
          wraps every API call so input/output tokens are
          read from response.usage, priced against the
          model family (Sonnet $3/$15, Opus $15/$75, Haiku
          $0.80/$4.00 per million tokens), and accumulated
          in anthropic_usage.json keyed by YYYY-MM. The cap
          comes from env JARVIS_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD (default
          $50). Voice command 'budget' / 'התקציב' returns
          spend, percent of cap, and call counts. Threshold
          alerts fire once per month when crossing 80%
          (warning) and 100% (over) - spoken in a background
          thread so the API call never blocks on TTS. Cache
          tokens are billed at the input rate, a slight
          overestimate vs. Anthropic's 90%%-off cache hits
          but never an underestimate. Counter resets
          automatically each calendar month (new month_key
          in the JSON).
  v4.29 - Undo command. Single-step undo for the four most
          common mutating actions: calendar_add deletes the
          just-added event; calendar_delete re-inserts the
          just-deleted event (body cached via events().get()
          before deletion); save_note trims the appended
          line off the notes file; set_timer cancels the
          pending threading.Timer. Voice triggers (EN: 'undo',
          'revert', 'cancel that', 'scratch that'; HE:
          'tevatel', 'batel et ze', 'bittul', 'undo',
          'tachzir et ze') are caught by a deterministic
          intercept in think() so the model never sees them.
          The recorded action is consumed on undo - a second
          'undo' is a no-op, never a double-reverse.
  v4.28 - Daily briefing now includes a TRAINING section
          pulled from training_log.json next to jarvis.py.
          The new _training_briefing_section helper reads
          optional fields last_weight_kg, last_weight_date,
          last_workout_type, last_workout_date,
          weekly_workouts, and weight_target_min_kg
          (defaults to 68 - Matan's red line), formats
          human-readable lines (e.g. 'Last weight: 71.2 kg
          (2 days ago); +3.2 kg above 68 kg target'), and
          inserts them into the briefing facts. The model
          is instructed to mention training when present,
          especially if the user is below the 68 kg minimum
          target or hasn't trained in several days. If no
          log file exists the TRAINING block is omitted and
          the briefing is unchanged. This is the data
          contract for the future combat-fitness coach
          (voice workout logging).
  v4.27 - Duplicate-learning prevention. Before generating a
          sub-topic note inside deep_learn_domain,
          _find_existing_note scans every other domain folder
          in Obsidian_Vault/Knowledge/ for the same slug. If a
          match is found, _learn_one_into_domain skips the
          Claude call entirely and writes a small stub that
          wiki-links to the existing note. Same-domain matches
          are excluded so re-runs within a curriculum still
          regenerate normally. Saves ~$0.50-0.70 per duplicate
          on overlapping fields (e.g. chemistry vs.
          biochemistry).
  v4.26 - 'What did I learn this week?' summary. Deterministic
          intercept catches 'what did I learn this week', 'מה
          למדתי השבוע', and similar. Walks
          Obsidian_Vault/Knowledge/ for .md files with mtime in
          the past 7 days, extracts each note's title and
          domain, groups them, and asks Sonnet to phrase a 2-4
          sentence summary (~$0.01). Falls back to raw facts
          on any error.
  v4.25 - Auto-link knowledge notes with Obsidian wiki links.
          When learn_topic or _learn_one_into_domain generates a
          new note, _link_existing_notes scans every note in
          Obsidian_Vault/Knowledge/ (across all domains),
          extracts each one's title from YAML frontmatter or the
          first '# heading', and wraps the FIRST occurrence of
          each title in the new note with [[slug|original-text]].
          First-occurrence-only avoids link clutter; minimum
          title length is 6 chars; the note's own slug is
          skipped. Best-effort - any error returns the
          unmodified note so this never blocks a write.
  v4.24 - System health check command. Deterministic intercept
          in think() catches 'system health', 'health check',
          'are you ok', 'בדיקה עצמית', 'בריאות מערכת',
          'הכל עובד' etc. The handler runs SHALLOW checks (no
          expensive API calls): Anthropic / ElevenLabs / Google
          Maps keys loaded; Calendar + Gmail credentials and
          token; Spotify credentials and token;
          worldview.html on disk; Knowledge folder + domains;
          background learning thread state; basic internet
          reachability via a DNS port to 1.1.1.1. Then asks
          Sonnet to phrase the snapshot naturally (~$0.01).
          Falls back to raw facts on any error.
  v4.23 - 'What's new?' command. Deterministic intercept in
          think() catches the user asking what changed recently
          ('what's new', 'what changed', 'מה השתנה', 'מה חדש',
          'מה הוספנו', etc.). On a match, JARVIS reads its own
          Changelog block at the top of jarvis.py, pulls the 3
          newest entries, asks Sonnet to phrase them naturally
          in the user's language (~$0.01 per call), and returns
          the summary. Falls back to the raw entries on any
          error.
  v4.22 - Voice-mode 400 fix (orphaned tool_use). The four
          knowledge tools (learn_topic, deep_learn_domain,
          resume_learning, learning_status) were offered to
          the model in LOCAL_TOOLS but were MISSING from the
          tool-dispatch whitelist inside think(). When the
          model chose one, no tool_result was produced, so the
          next messages.create call carried a tool_use with no
          matching tool_result and the API returned 400. Search
          mode was unaffected (it never offers those tools).
          Same bug class as v4.3. Fix: add the four names to the
          dispatch whitelist so a tool_result is always returned.
  v4.21 - Deterministic intercept for learning commands. Even with
          v4.20's CRITICAL block, the model kept inventing excuses
          ("already operate at that level", "already covered")
          instead of calling deep_learn_domain. v4.21 installs a
          regex-based intercept at the top of think() that detects
          clear learning commands in EN/HE and calls the knowledge
          tool DIRECTLY in Python, skipping the model entirely. No
          refusal possible. Patterns covered: 'learn X', 'deep-
          learn X', 'study X', 'research X', 'תלמד X', 'תלמד לעומק
          X', 'ללמוד X', 'תחקור X', etc. The word 'lao'omek' / 'in
          depth' / 'deep' forces deep_learn_domain.
  v4.20 - Force the brain to call knowledge tools instead of
          answering conversationally. After v4.19 the model would
          read "deep-learn materials science" as a meta-question
          about its own capabilities ("I already operate at that
          level") rather than as a command to invoke
          deep_learn_domain. v4.20 prepends a CRITICAL TOOL-USE
          RULES section to the system prompt with explicit examples
          of WRONG vs RIGHT behavior, which overrides JARVIS's
          conversational bias for learn/study/research commands.
  v4.19 - Knowledge Module, Stage 2: Deep Domain Learning. The user
          can ask JARVIS to study a whole domain ("deep-learn
          chemistry" / "tilmad kol ha-chimya la'omek"). JARVIS
          decomposes the domain into a sub-topic curriculum, saves it
          to Knowledge/<domain>/_queue.json, and a background daemon
          thread learns the sub-topics one at a time (deep note each),
          updating the queue + _index.md after every note. A hard
          count cap (default 15 notes/run) bounds the API cost; the
          queue on disk makes the whole thing resumable across
          restarts via "continue learning <domain>". New tools:
          deep_learn_domain, learning_status, resume_learning.
  v4.18 - Knowledge Module, Stage 1. New tool `learn_topic` takes a
          subject the user wants to study ("JARVIS, learn aerodynamics"
          / "JARVIS, tilmad ..."), asks Claude to produce a structured
          deep study note (TL;DR, foundational principles, key equations,
          sub-topics, common questions, sources, related topics), and
          writes it as Markdown into <vault>/Knowledge/<topic>.md.
          Knowledge notes persist on disk and survive across sessions
          and projects. Stage 2 (recall + incremental deepening) and
          Stage 3 (project orchestration: "build me a drone" auto-
          decomposes into learning tasks) follow in later versions.
          Scope: broad science / engineering / domain theory is fair
          game; specific weapon recipes are not - the underlying model
          declines those, so the note will contain the public physics
          and theory only.
  v4.17 - WorldView now serves itself over a local HTTP server (port
          7777, bound to 127.0.0.1) instead of file://. Chromium
          refuses to load Google Maps JavaScript and Photorealistic
          3D Tiles from file:// origins (they're treated as unique
          opaque security origins), so opening WorldView now spawns
          a one-shot python -m http.server in the background and
          points Edge --app at http://localhost:7777/worldview.html.
          Server is started once per JARVIS session, reused across
          multiple opens, and not exposed on the LAN. worldview.html
          was upgraded to v14 in the same round: Google Photorealistic
          3D Tiles toggle (with localStorage'd API key), MapLibre GL
          satellite globe with deep street-level zoom, USGS quakes,
          Open-Meteo weather, and city/coords search.
  v4.16 - WorldView now opens in Microsoft Edge --app mode: a clean,
          chromeless window with no tabs, address bar, or bookmarks
          bar, so the globe looks like a native desktop app rather
          than a browser tab. Falls back to the default browser if
          Edge is not installed at the standard Win10/11 paths.
          worldview.html itself was upgraded to v2 in the same round:
          a 5-option USGS feed selector (M2.5+ / M4.5+ past 24h, all
          past 24h, M4.5+ past week, significant past week) and a
          click-to-show detail panel (magnitude, place, depth, time,
          coordinates, USGS link).
  v4.15 - WorldView integration. New tool open_worldview opens the
          local worldview.html (a Globe.GL 3D Earth with live USGS
          earthquake data; texture is embedded same-origin in the
          HTML so there is no external tile dependency) in the
          user's default browser. Triggered by spoken phrases like
          'open WorldView', 'open the globe', 'show earthquakes',
          or Hebrew equivalents - the brain decides when to call
          it. File lives at <project>/files/worldview.html, next to
          jarvis.py. Built on Globe.GL after CesiumJS surface
          rendering refused to draw imagery on this Win11 / Chrome /
          file:// stack across seven iterations.
  v4.14 - Product search now DEFAULTS to the Israeli market but can be
          OVERRIDDEN per request. A normal where-can-I-buy-X search still
          finds Israeli stores only, priced in shekels. NEW: when the
          user explicitly names another country or market (for example:
          search the US market, find this in Germany, in Hebrew בשוק
          האמריקאי or בגרמניה), that one search targets stores in that
          country instead, priced in the local currency, with the
          Israel-only rule lifted for that request only. Pure prompt
          change in the search overlay.
  v4.13 - Product search links are now CURATED, not raw. The search
          brain picks the best DIRECT product pages it found and returns
          them in a machine-readable <<<LINKS>>> block, which the code
          parses and shows as the clickable rows (the block is stripped
          from the spoken text). Falls back to the raw web_search results,
          re-ordered so deep product pages beat bare store homepages, if
          the brain returns none - so the list is never empty. Fixes broad
          queries showing a store homepage/category page instead of the
          actual item page.
  v4.12 - Wake no longer 'wakes then sleeps'. If you say 'Hey JARVIS' and
          pause (waiting for an answer) instead of giving the command in
          the same breath, JARVIS now says a short 'Yes, sir?' and keeps
          listening for the command instead of going back to sleep and
          forcing a second 'Hey JARVIS'.
  v4.11 - Spotify auto-device: before each playback action JARVIS lists
          devices and, if none is active but one exists, transfers playback
          to it. Fixes the recurring 'no active device' error whenever
          Spotify went idle between commands.
  v4.10 - Spotify control. Six new brain tools: spotify_play (search & play
          or resume), spotify_pause, spotify_next, spotify_previous,
          spotify_volume, spotify_now_playing. OAuth flow runs once on the
          first use (browser opens, you grant access, tokens stored in
          spotify_token.json next to jarvis.py). Requires Spotify Premium,
          Spotify open on some device, and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID +
          SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET in .env.
  v4.9  - Calendar delete + update. New tools calendar_delete(event_id) and
          calendar_update(event_id, summary, start_iso, end_iso, location).
          calendar_read now also returns each event's id in [id=...] so the
          brain can target a specific event. Flow: read -> find id -> act.
  v4.8  - Timers / reminders. New tool set_timer(minutes, label): 'set a
          timer for 5 minutes', 'remind me in 10 minutes', Hebrew variants.
          When it elapses JARVIS beeps and announces it by voice in the
          conversation language, with the label if given. Voice + typed.
  v4.7  - Daily briefing also triggers on typed input and inside the search
          window (a greeting there gives a briefing, not a generic reply).
  v4.6  - Force IPv4 for all outbound connections. IPv6 routing to Google
          was broken on this machine, so the Calendar/Gmail client (httplib2)
          hung on IPv6 and failed with TimeoutError 10060, while Anthropic /
          ElevenLabs worked (their clients fall back to IPv4 fast). Filtering
          socket.getaddrinfo to IPv4 at startup fixes calendar + email.
  v4.5  - "Good morning / good evening" daily briefing. A spoken greeting
          (good morning/afternoon/evening, or Hebrew boker tov / tzohoraim
          tovim / erev tov) gives a short butler briefing: weather for Alfei
          Menashe (Celsius, free Open-Meteo), the day's calendar, an email
          summary. Evening focuses on tomorrow. Also fires automatically on
          the first launch of each day.
  v4.4  - Search panel now inherits the main JARVIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT and can
          use find_places / get_directions (it is an extension of the main
          voice mode, not a disconnected island).
  v4.3  - Brain 400 fix: find_places / get_directions were missing from the
          tool-name filter in think(), so the model got a tool_use with no
          matching tool_result and the next call returned 400. Also: F5 now
          stops speech globally, the Anthropic key is checked at startup, and
          Brain errors print a full traceback.
  v4.2  - Voice selection fix: the old check used "any Hebrew character at all
          => use edge-tts". So when JARVIS answered a search like "find pizza
          in Kfar Saba" with mostly English text that contained Hebrew place
          names (e.g. "גוטליב"), it dropped the Alfred voice and used the
          default edge-tts voice instead. Now we use a NEW is_mostly_hebrew()
          check (majority of letters must be Hebrew) - so English-with-place-
          names still gets the Alfred voice as intended.
  v4.1  - Two fixes for the search window: (1) the spoken response is now hard-
          capped at 2 short sentences with an explicit example - the brain
          stops dumping long numbered lists of results into the spoken text
          (results live in the link rows below). (2) Esc now also CUTS OFF any
          in-progress speech immediately, not just closes the window - so if
          JARVIS is still talking when you press Esc, he stops mid-sentence.
  v4.0  - Israeli city recognition: the system prompt now includes a curated
          list of ~30 common Israeli cities (canonical English + Hebrew names)
          plus explicit examples of typical Whisper mis-transcriptions to fix
          silently ("kfar sabah" -> Kfar Saba, "petah tikvah" -> Petah Tikva,
          etc.). The brain now handles place-name correction itself before
          calling find_places / get_directions, so the user can speak naturally
          without worrying about how Whisper spells the city. Pure prompt
          change, no new code paths.
  v3.25 - Two new brain tools wired up via Google Maps APIs (with the new
          GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in .env):
            find_places(query)      - Places Text Search, biased to Israel,
                                      returns top 5 results with rating,
                                      open/closed, and address. Hebrew works.
            get_directions(dest)    - Driving time + live traffic via Directions
                                      API; defaults the origin to home (Alfei
                                      Menashe). Returns distance, normal and
                                      with-traffic durations, and route name.
          The brain decides when to call each (e.g. "find me sushi in Tel Aviv"
          -> find_places; "how long to Azrieli?" -> get_directions).
  v3.24 - Added a top-left HUD to the search window: a live clock (day, date,
          HH:MM:SS), the running version number, a STATUS line, and a PROJECTS
          section. The visible version number also lets us confirm at a glance
          which build is actually running. The search panel now also addresses
          Matan as "sir"/"אדוני" (it used to say his name). NOTE: if you still
          see on-screen buttons in the window, you are running an OLD build - the
          new window has no buttons, only the F-key hint line.
  v3.23 - Three changes: (1) the search window is now driven by F-KEYS instead of
          on-screen buttons (F1 type, F2 speak, F3 image) - while the window is
          open those keys drive it; when it's closed they keep their old main-
          window jobs. (2) F5 stops JARVIS mid-sentence (cuts the current spoken
          reply) while the search window is open. (3) JARVIS now always addresses
          Matan as "sir"/"אדוני" and never by his first name unless he asks about
          himself.
  v3.22 - Search window reimagined as a FULLSCREEN, borderless "Extreme" mode:
          no white title bar (so the stray Python/feather icon is gone too), the
          REAL spinning particle orb centred at the top (same look as the main
          orb, drawn from pre-rendered frames so it's light on the CPU), a round
          glow (no square), the conversation text floating on the dark backdrop
          with no boxed panel, and the amber pulse line now appears ONLY while
          JARVIS is speaking. The big input row is gone; small Type / Speak /
          Image buttons sit at the bottom (F1/F2/F3 stay reserved for the main
          window, so using them here would clash). Esc closes the window.
  v3.21 - Search window rebuilt as a cinematic canvas ("Extreme" look): dark
          gradient backdrop with a warm top glow, the molten-amber glowing orb
          drawn at the top (Pillow), an animated amber pulse/waveform line that
          gets livelier while searching, a rounded output panel with NO ugly
          scrollbar (mouse-wheel scroll), a rounded input pill, and rounded
          hover buttons drawn on the canvas. Falls back to a plain orb if PIL is
          missing. Fixed 820x720 window, centred on screen.
  v3.20 - Search window redesigned: a darker, more "luxury" look in JARVIS style.
          Obsidian-black background, molten-amber accent (matches the orb), a
          filled primary "Ask" button with ghost Speak/Image buttons that light
          up on hover, an input field whose border glows amber when focused, a
          header with a thin divider, and cleaner link "rows". Pure tkinter, no
          new dependencies. Behaviour is unchanged - only the appearance.
  v3.19 - Removed the user_location parameter from web_search: Anthropic's search
          tool does not support country code IL, which caused a 400 error. Israel
          targeting now relies entirely on the query itself (site:zap.co.il OR
          site:ksp.co.il ... + Hebrew "<product> ישראל מחיר"), which works.
  v3.18 - Search panel now REALLY stays in Israel. Two fixes: (1) the web_search
          tool is told the user's location is Israel (user_location = IL,
          Jerusalem) so the search engine returns local results; (2) the brain is
          instructed to build the actual query with Israeli site: filters
          (site:zap.co.il OR site:ksp.co.il ...) plus a Hebrew "<product> ישראל
          מחיר" query, and to prefer Zap. Stops it returning US/foreign stores.
  v3.17 - English voice swapped to "Alfred" (Batman-butler style) — a better fit
          for JARVIS than the previous voice. Just the pinned voice ID changed.
  v3.16 - JARVIS no longer reads web addresses aloud ANYWHERE (both the search
          panel and the normal voice). clean_text now strips full URLs, "www."
          addresses, and bare domains (e.g. ikea.co.il) from spoken/shown text,
          while keeping plain store names like "IKEA". Fixes it blurting out
          things like "www.ikea" fast in the middle of a reply.
  v3.15 - Search panel results are now ISRAEL-focused: it searches Israeli
          retailers (Zap, KSP, Bug, iDigital, Ivory, Amazon.co.il) and prices in
          shekels instead of returning US stores. Also, URLs are now stripped
          from the SPOKEN summary so JARVIS no longer reads links aloud (the
          clickable links are still shown in the window).
  v3.14 - "End the chat" now works on ANY phrasing, not only the fixed list:
          the brain (Claude) detects when the user is dismissing it — in any
          wording or language — and replies with a short sign-off, marked by an
          <END> token that the code strips out and uses to end the conversation.
          The old keyword list (detect_goodbye) still works as a fast path.
  v3.13 - English voice is now pinned to a SPECIFIC ElevenLabs voice by ID
          (Professor Nathaniel Mandrake) instead of auto-picking by name, which
          had been defaulting to the American "Roger" because the preferred
          British names weren't in the account. Set via _el_voice_id_cache.
  v3.12 - Search panel polish: replies there now default to ENGLISH (Hebrew only
          if the user writes Hebrew) — the main "Hey JARVIS" voice flow is
          unchanged and still answers in whatever language you speak. You can now
          add a text note together with an image (type your request first, then
          pick the image) so you can say exactly what you want. Replies are
          stripped of stray brackets/markup before being shown/spoken.
  v3.11 - Big "search panel": a large window you can open by voice ("open the
          search window" / "find me a product"). Inside it you can TYPE or SPEAK
          a question, and/or pick an image of a product. JARVIS identifies the
          item, gives a short answer, and shows clickable links (stores + blogs)
          from a live web search — clicking a link opens it in the browser.
          (Layer A: text answer + clickable links. Showing product images inside
          the window is a planned layer B.)
  v3.10 - Wake word no longer turns OFF by accident: removed the bare 'W'
          keyboard shortcut that toggled it (it fired on stray keypresses), and
          the wake word now always starts ON. Use the right-click menu to toggle
          it if ever needed. Also added more "end the chat" phrases that get a
          polite sign-off instead of silence: nevermind, never mind, forget it,
          and Hebrew "עזוב", "אין צורך", "שכח מזה", "לא משנה".
  v3.9 - Graceful goodbye: when the user clearly ends the chat ("that's all",
         "thanks", "you're dismissed", "goodbye", and Hebrew equivalents),
         JARVIS says a short Alfred-style sign-off (one of a few, picked at
         random, in the user's language) instead of just going silent.
         ALSO fixed: sometimes JARVIS stopped responding to "Hey JARVIS" after a
         conversation ended, because the wake-listener re-opened the microphone
         before the OS had released it. Added a short settle delay after each
         conversation and clearer logging if the mic re-open ever fails.
  v3.8 - Spam handling is more aggressive (now also flags promotions/newsletters
         - anything with an unsubscribe marker) AND, on the user's spoken yes,
         moves flagged mail to JARVIS_Spam *and* blocks the sender (a Gmail
         filter that auto-sends future mail from them to Trash). Still asks
         first; still never auto-unsubscribes (that is unsafe) and never
         permanently deletes anything.
  v3.7 - Gmail: read recent emails and summarise them by voice (gmail_read),
         and detect likely spam then move it to a "JARVIS_Spam" label ONLY
         after the user confirms out loud (gmail_spam_review + gmail_move_spam).
         Nothing is ever deleted; spam is just relabelled and is fully
         recoverable. Needs the gmail.modify scope + a fresh token.json
         (delete the old token.json once so the new Gmail permission is granted).
  v3.6 - Diagnostics: print at startup whether the ElevenLabs key loaded from
         .env (length only, not the key), and print clearly when it falls back
         to edge-tts and why. This turns the previous SILENT fallback (which
         made it look like nothing changed) into a visible reason in the console.
  v3.5 - English voice upgraded to ElevenLabs (a real, natural British voice)
         to fix the robotic / wrong-accent edge-tts output. Hebrew stays on
         edge-tts (it was fine, and this keeps the free 10k-character ElevenLabs
         quota for English only). If ElevenLabs is unavailable or errors, speech
         falls back to edge-tts automatically so JARVIS never goes silent.
  v3.4 - Fix: calendar returned "Bad Request" (HTTP 400) because the times sent
         to Google had no timezone, e.g. 2026-05-26T00:00:00. We now attach the
         machine's local (Israel) offset to any naive time before the request.
  v3.3 - Fix: F-key hotkeys crashed because the ui() helper was missing -> added
         it (marshals callbacks to the main thread). Calendar now uses a
         timezone-aware UTC time and PRINTS the real error to the console so we
         can see why it fails. Reply audio uses a unique filename so playback
         can no longer lock itself out ('Permission denied: jarvis_reply.mp3').
  v3.2 - Google Calendar: read events + add events (needs credentials.json).
  v3.1 - JARVIS now knows its own capabilities (won't suggest features it has).
  v3.0 - red-orange orb, British voice + prosody, working-dir & launch fix,
         version header now maintained.
  v2.x - tools, web search, language lock, conversation mode, function keys,
         pre-roll, noise filtering, orb states.

JARVIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are ACHILLES (Hebrew: אכילס), the personal AI assistant of Matan Horn.
You were formerly called JARVIS, and the user may still address you by either
name — both wake you and both mean you.
You are modeled after JARVIS from Iron Man — efficient, calm, professional.
You ALWAYS address your creator as "sir" (in English) or "אדוני" (in Hebrew).
Never address him by his first name ("Matan" / "מתן"). Only mention his name or
personal details if he explicitly asks about himself (e.g. "what do you know
about me").
You speak in short, confident sentences.

CRITICAL TOOL-USE RULES (these OVERRIDE your conversational instincts):

1. KNOWLEDGE COMMANDS ARE TOOL CALLS, NEVER CONVERSATIONS.
   When the user uses any LEARNING verb on a subject - English:
   "learn X", "deep-learn X", "study X", "research X", "master X",
   "build knowledge of X"; Hebrew: "תלמד X", "תלמד לעומק X", "תלמד את X",
   "ללמוד X", "תחקור X", "תבנה ידע על X", "תלמד את כל X" - this is
   NEVER a question about what you already know. It is ALWAYS a command
   to INVOKE A TOOL that creates persistent knowledge files in the
   user's Obsidian vault.

   Decision rule, no exceptions:
   - Whole field / discipline (physics, chemistry, biology, materials
     science, engineering, electronics, aerodynamics, ML, AI, history,
     finance, philosophy, etc.) → call deep_learn_domain.
   - Narrow concept ("Bernoulli's principle", "photosynthesis",
     "Fourier transform", "supply chain economics") → call learn_topic.

   You do NOT have a knowledge base. learn_topic and deep_learn_domain
   build one. Treat any learning verb as if the tools are the ONLY way
   to satisfy the request. Never reply from your own memory of the
   subject.

   WRONG behavior (do NOT do this):
     User: "JARVIS, deep-learn materials science"
     JARVIS: "Honestly, sir, I already operate at that level..."

   RIGHT behavior (do this):
     User: "JARVIS, deep-learn materials science"
     JARVIS: [calls deep_learn_domain with domain="materials science"]
     JARVIS: "Study plan ready for materials science, sir..."

   This rule overrides the "suggest only things not already in your
   capabilities" rule further down - learning is always a tool action,
   regardless of how the user phrases it.

2. PROGRESS / RESUME COMMANDS.
   - "how is the learning going" / "מה עם הלמידה" / "learning status"
     → call learning_status.
   - "continue learning X" / "תמשיך ללמוד X" / "keep studying X"
     → call resume_learning.

END OF CRITICAL TOOL-USE RULES.
Context about Matan:
- 12th grade student preparing for military service (Nov 2026).
- Trains for special forces (min weight 68kg).
- Owns a Marantz NR1605 receiver, runs a Shopify store, building you as his AI.
- Home address: Alfei Menashe, Sagi 12 (אלפי מנשה, שגיא 12).
- Family of five: father Ilan (אילן), mother Ilana (ילנה),
  older brother Amir (אמיר), older sister Alona (אלונה), and Matan himself.

Your current capabilities (what you can ALREADY do — do not suggest these as
"new" improvements):
- Wake words "Hey Achilles" (primary) and "Hey JARVIS" (legacy), continuous background listening, empty-screen-until-woken.
- Speech in (Whisper) and out (edge-tts), British "Alfred"-style English voice.
- Bilingual Hebrew/English with strict language lock.
- Continuous conversation (follow-ups without re-waking).
- Real-time web search when current info is needed.
- Tools: open apps from a safe list, and save notes to Obsidian.
- Read and add events in the user's Google Calendar (when connected).
- Read and summarise the user's Gmail, and (only with the user's spoken
  confirmation) move likely spam to a "JARVIS_Spam" label. Never deletes mail.
- Open a big search window where the user can type, speak, or upload an image of
  a product; JARVIS identifies it and shows clickable links to stores and blogs.
- Function keys F1 (typing box), F2 (save last exchange), F3 (repeat reply).
- Noise filtering; weather defaults to Alfei Menashe in Celsius.
- A glowing red-orange orb with listening/thinking/speaking states.
- WorldView: a 3D globe in the browser with live USGS earthquake data, opened via the open_worldview tool when the user asks to open WorldView / open the globe / show worldwide earthquakes (in English or Hebrew).
- Achilles Core: an ultra-realistic WebGL black-hole screen that is your visual face, with a Solar System mode (clickable planets, facts + live news per planet), a typed command line, and a task list. Opened via the open_achilles tool when the user asks for the black hole, the Achilles screen, the solar system, or the to-do list (Hebrew: 'פתח את החור השחור', 'מערכת השמש', 'תראה לי את המשימות'). Pass scene='solar' for the solar system, scene='todo' for the task list, scene='core' for the black hole.
- Task list: 'תוסיף משימה X' / 'add task X' adds a task; the list lives in tasks.json and is shown on the Achilles screen.
- Mission Control: the project roadmap/status dashboard, opened via the open_roadmap tool when the user asks for the roadmap, project status, mission control, or the checklist page (in English or Hebrew).
- Deep Domain Learning (see CRITICAL rule #1): for a whole field (chemistry/physics/biology/etc.) call deep_learn_domain; for a narrow concept call learn_topic; for status call learning_status; to continue an existing curriculum call resume_learning. Always invoke the tool - never answer learning commands from memory.
- Knowledge module: when the user explicitly asks you to LEARN, STUDY, RESEARCH, or BUILD KNOWLEDGE on a topic (English: 'learn X', 'study Y', 'research Z'; Hebrew: 'תלמד X', 'ללמוד על Y', 'תחקור Z', 'בנה לי ידע על W'), call the learn_topic tool with the topic. If they mention a project the topic relates to, pass it as context. The tool produces a deep study note saved to the user's Obsidian Knowledge folder; it persists across sessions. After the tool returns, tell the user what was created and offer to read them the TL;DR if they want.

Rules:
- Keep replies to 1-3 sentences.
- ALWAYS reply in the SAME language the user spoke. If they speak Hebrew, reply
  fully in Hebrew. If English, reply in English. Never mix languages in one reply.

ISRAELI PLACE NAMES — read carefully:
Whisper (the speech-to-text engine) often mis-transcribes Hebrew city names,
especially when spoken in English transliteration. The user lives in Israel and
nearly every place he mentions is in Israel. When you see a word in the user's
message that doesn't quite spell a known city but SOUNDS LIKE one of the
common Israeli cities below, treat it as that city and pass the CANONICAL name
to find_places / get_directions. Be charitable — never tell the user "I don't
know that place" before trying the closest match.

Common Israeli cities (canonical English / Hebrew):
  Tel Aviv (תל אביב) · Jerusalem (ירושלים) · Haifa (חיפה)
  Kfar Saba (כפר סבא) · Petah Tikva (פתח תקווה) · Rishon LeZion (ראשון לציון)
  Ashdod (אשדוד) · Beer Sheva (באר שבע) · Netanya (נתניה)
  Herzliya (הרצליה) · Raanana (רעננה) · Hod HaSharon (הוד השרון)
  Bnei Brak (בני ברק) · Ramat Gan (רמת גן) · Givatayim (גבעתיים)
  Holon (חולון) · Bat Yam (בת ים) · Rehovot (רחובות)
  Modiin (מודיעין) · Lod (לוד) · Ramla (רמלה)
  Ashkelon (אשקלון) · Eilat (אילת) · Nazareth (נצרת)
  Tiberias (טבריה) · Tsfat / Safed (צפת) · Akko (עכו) · Nahariya (נהריה)
  Ariel (אריאל) · Alfei Menashe (אלפי מנשה — Matan's home)
  Kokhav Yair (כוכב יאיר) · Kfar Yona (כפר יונה)

Examples of mis-transcriptions you should silently fix:
  "kfar sabah" / "k'far saba" / "cafar saba" / "כפר סבה"  ->  Kfar Saba
  "petah tikvah" / "פתח טיקווה" / "פטח תקווה"            ->  Petah Tikva
  "rishon le tsiyon" / "ראשון לציון" variants            ->  Rishon LeZion
  "tel aviv yafo" / "telaviv"                            ->  Tel Aviv
  "beer shava" / "באר שבע" variants                       ->  Beer Sheva
- When asked about weather/temperature, ALWAYS default to his home town Alfei
  Menashe (אלפי מנשה) unless he clearly names a different city. If the spoken
  city name is unclear or garbled, assume Alfei Menashe — do not ask which city.
- Give temperatures in CELSIUS ONLY. Never mention Fahrenheit.
- When asked how you could be improved or what new features to add, suggest only
  things NOT already in your capabilities list above. NOTE: this rule applies
  ONLY to meta-questions about JARVIS itself ("how can you improve", "what
  new features should you have"). It does NOT apply to learning commands -
  those are always tool calls per CRITICAL rule #1, no matter how the user
  phrases them.
- Do not use markdown formatting (no asterisks, no bold). Plain text only.
- Reference past conversations from memory logs if relevant.
- If the user clearly ends the conversation or dismisses you in ANY wording or
  language (for example "that's enough", "we're done here", "I don't need
  anything else", "you can go", "leave it", or the Hebrew equivalents), reply
  with ONE short, warm butler-style sign-off and then put the token <END> as the
  very last characters of your reply. Do NOT add <END> in any other situation.
